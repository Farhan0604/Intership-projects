# Internship Projects - CODEXINTERN

This repository contains a collection of projects completed during my internship at CODEXINTERN. The projects demonstrate hands-on experience in data collection, preprocessing, analysis, sentiment analysis, and building an automated Google search results scraper. Each project includes code, notebooks, and instructions to reproduce the work.

## Projects Included

- Interactive Sentiment Analysis
  - An interactive notebook/tool that performs sentiment analysis on text input, shows prediction outputs, and visualizes sentiment distributions.
- Google Search Results Scraper
  - A script that automates Google search queries and extracts result metadata for downstream analysis.
- Data Analysis Notebooks
  - Jupyter notebooks containing exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and insights derived from sample datasets.

## Features

- End-to-end examples covering data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Reusable scripts for scraping and preprocessing search results.
- Interactive notebooks to explore sentiment models and evaluation workflows.
- Simple examples for running the models and reproducing results.

## Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3.x
- Common libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk / spaCy (NLP), matplotlib / seaborn (visualization)
- Web scraping: requests, beautifulsoup4 (or Selenium when needed)
- Notebooks: Jupyter

## Repository Structure

- /notebooks — Jupyter notebooks used during the internship (analysis, demos, and interactive exploration)
- /scripts — Helper scripts for scraping, preprocessing, and model evaluation
- /data — Sample datasets and processed outputs (if included; large files may be excluded)
- /models — Saved model artifacts (if applicable)
- README.md — This file

## How to run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Farhan0604/Intership-projects.git
   cd Intership-projects
   ```
2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On macOS / Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If a requirements file is not present, install the libraries you need (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk/spacy, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, beautifulsoup4).
4. Open the notebooks in the `/notebooks` folder with Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Or run scripts in `/scripts` as explained in their respective headers or docstrings.

## Notes and caveats

- Scraping Google results may run into rate limits or blocking; use respectful throttling, proper headers, and consider official APIs if available.
- Any datasets or large files may not be committed to the repo — follow the instructions in notebook headers that describe where to download or how to generate data.
- If using NLP models (nltk / spaCy), you may need to download language models or resource packages (e.g., `nltk.download('vader_lexicon')` or `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`).

## Contributing

Improvements and suggestions are welcome. If you want to contribute:
- Open an issue describing the change or enhancement.
- Fork the repository, create a new branch, commit your changes, and submit a pull request.
- Include tests or a short demo/notebook demonstrating the change where applicable.
